# [[Native Modules]]

ðŸ“‘ **Tags**:  #note

There are times when the performance of Javascript is not enough. So you have to depend on native Node.JS modules.

## COMMON USE CASES OF NATIVE NODE.JS MODULES
- Performance critical applications (asynchronous I/O operations)
- Hooking into lower level APIs (e.g. operating-system)
- Creating bridge between C or C++ libraries and Node.js

## NATIVE MODULES

==Node.js addons are dynamically-linked shared objects, written in C or C++, that can be loaded into Node.js using the require() function and used just as if they were an ordinary Node.js module.==
