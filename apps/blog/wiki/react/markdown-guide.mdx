## MDX content

We just saw that MDX files are compiled to components.
You can use those components like any other component in your framework of
choice.
Take this file:

```mdx path="example.mdx"
# Hi!
```

It could be imported and used in a React app like so:

```js path="example.js"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import Example from './example.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

ReactDom.render(<Example />, document.querySelector('#root'))
```

The main content is exported as the default export.
All other values are also exported.
Take this example:

```mdx path="example.mdx"
export const Thing = () => <>World</>

# Hello <Thing />
```
